Description: This package simulates the Monty Hall problem from the television show Let's Make a Deal. In the game there are three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and twohave goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when given the option to switch, so this simulation was created to test both strategies.
